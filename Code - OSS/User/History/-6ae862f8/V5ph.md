# Kubernetes Homelab on Alpine Linux ☸

Hey there! 👋 This is my homelab Kubernetes cluster running on **Alpine Linux**—because why not keep things lightweight and fast?  

### What's Inside?  
- **1 Master Node** – The boss. Handles all the control plane stuff.  
- **2 Worker Nodes** – The muscle. Runs all the containers like a champ.  

### Why Alpine?  
- Tiny footprint 🐜  
- Super simple & fast 🚀  
- No bloat, just Kubernetes doing its thing  

### What’s Running?  
- **k3s** (because full K8s is overkill for a homelab)  
- Some basic deployments (because `kubectl apply` is life)  
- Probably too many experimental manifests that I’ll regret later  

### Why Should You Care?  
If you're into:  
- Breaking things and fixing them (hopefully)  
- Running Kubernetes on something other than Ubuntu/Debian  
- Overcomplicating your home network for fun  

Feel free to poke around, steal ideas, or judge my YAML files. PRs welcome if you spot something dumb. 😄  

**Deploy all the things!** 🚢🔥
