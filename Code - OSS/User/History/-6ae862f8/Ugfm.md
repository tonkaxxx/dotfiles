# Kubernetes Homelab on Alpine Linux â˜¸

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my homelab Kubernetes cluster running on **Alpine Linux**

### What's Inside?
- **1 Master Node**
- **2 Worker Nodes**

### Why now Ubuntu?  
- Super simple and fast!
- Limited resources on my nodes
- Always wanted to try something new!  

### Whatâ€™s Running?  
- Cluster deployed with kubeadm (someone can say kubeadm is overkill, but i say its practiceðŸ˜‰) 
- Telegram bot to track my lenses schedule

Feel free to poke around, steal ideas, or judge my YAML files. ðŸ˜„
